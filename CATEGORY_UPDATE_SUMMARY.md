- FM (Fodder & Forage) → IS (Industrial Supplies)
- FL (Flowers & Ornamental Plants) → HL (Home & Living)
- HR (Herbs & Medicinal Plants) → HB (Health & Beauty)
- OT (Other) → OT (Other) - unchanged

## Files Modified

### Model Changes
1. **producer/models.py** - Updated Product.ProductCategory choices
2. **market/models.py** - Updated MarketplaceUserProduct.ProductCategory choices

### Test Updates
3. **market/tests.py** - Updated test data to use "EG" instead of "EL"

### Migration Files
4. **producer/migrations/0040_update_product_categories.py** - Data migration to update existing Product records
5. **market/migrations/0028_update_marketplace_product_categories.py** - Data migration to update existing MarketplaceUserProduct records

## Database Migration Steps
To apply these changes:

1. Run migrations for producer app:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate producer
   ```

2. Run migrations for market app:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate market
   ```

The data migrations will automatically convert existing category values in the database.

## API Impact
- All API responses that include product categories will now return the new category codes
- Frontend applications should be updated to handle the new category values
- Filtering by category will continue to work with the new values

## Backward Compatibility
The migrations include reverse operations, so if needed, you can roll back the changes. However, note that the reverse mapping is lossy since multiple old categories map to the same new category.

## Next Steps
1. Update frontend applications to use new category codes
2. Update any documentation that references the old category codes
3. Update any hardcoded category filters in API calls
4. Test the category filtering functionality thoroughly
